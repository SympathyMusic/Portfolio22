              <li>The wider you are the skinnier you are, because you have more skin.
              <li>It's only when you look at an ant through a magnifying glass on a sunny day that you realize how often they burst into flames.
              <li>2,298 is the largest number you can count on your fingers if you have 2,288 extra fingers.
              <li>I'm glad plants can't talk because when you water them they'd make gross drinking noises and be like "mmmMMMMmmmMMM" and it'd be so uncomfortable. 
              <li>We have the perfect number of fingers to fit gloves.
              <li>If you pretend you are an actor, you are acting.
