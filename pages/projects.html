            <div class="flexbox-item item-3">My first project in P5js, if you ignore my earlier, failed attempts. It emulates the little-known indie game Pong, to be played with 2 players (such as the friend you're definitely reading this website with). There's a small circle moving around, which bounces off of walls and paddles. W and S control the left paddle, I and K control the right. <a href="/Portfolio22/projectcodes/pong.txt">Check out the code here.</a>

In this project, there was certaintly a few difficulties. For example, the leaves were meant to have an anchor at one specific point. But I couldn't figure that out, so I employed my strategy of "give up and try something else".<a href="/Portfolio22/projectcodes/birb.txt">Check out the code here.</a>

            <div class="flexbox-item item-3">Believe it or not, all of those little squares are dice (they have six possible states, so, technically, they are dice). This is done through a dice class, which takes an x and y input for the constructor. Then, a simple for loop creates an array of dice, constantly rolling. The sum total of all the dice is printed in the console log, which I'm not certain that you can see. One difficulty I had was making sure that the for loop worked, because I can't seem to figure it out in javscript. I ended up needing to ask for help.<a href="/Portfolio22/projectcodes/no_dice.txt">Check out the code here.</a>

Rainbow vomit mold comes down from the top, but, at a certain point, white mold creeps up from the bottom. Then, the whole thing resets. That resetting was a headache for me. It turns out i needed to re-initialize the mold arrays before calling setup. Then, it worked like a charm.<a href="/Portfolio22/projectcodes/strawberries.txt">Check out the code here.</a>
